# Colorful bar

This project (in it's first iteration) is just a simple game.
With keys "A" and "D" you move the bar left or right.
If the bar touch the falling box, it will change the color
to the color of the box. The color of the text "color"
will also be changed. 

Some values are written in the .db file.

Project is being created in Python with SQLite database manage system.

It will by updated one time a week with new features & code improvements. 

To launch it you have make sure you have all libraries installed (before that
move, I recommend you to make it inside the any kind of virtual environment:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

after that, just enjoy the game by pressing

```
python main.py
```

or, in the case you use Linux

```
python3 main.py
```
